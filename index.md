## About me
I am currently a Doctoral Researcher in Department of Computer Science at the Aalto University. Before starting my journey as a researcher, I used to be a programmer and have helped building some of the most used Finnish mobile applications while working at Futurice and Compile.

I am **not** looking for a job as a software developer. However, I am most of the time up for discussing about topics related to my research.

## About my research

The topic of my research is the Automatic generation of UI variants for software product hypothesis validation. My thesis supervisor is professor Fabian Fagerholm.

To give some context, Continuous Experimentation (Fagerholm et al. 2017) is a software product development approach that uses field experiments and promotes data-based decision-making. One form of field experiments is A/B-testing (e.g. Quin et al. 2024) of different UI variants. Users are exposed to different variants, and the data collected during the use is used to determine which variant is the best.

Currently, designers and developers must work hard to produce the variants for the experiments described above, and my research attempts to reduce the amount of manual work required to produce these variants
